# AlarmClockTkinter

Acknowledgments
This project was created as an educational example and demonstration, during my internship at SYNC INTERN'S, of using the Tkinter library to build a simple Alarm Clock. The application allows users to set an alarm time in a 24-hour format and notifies them with a message when the set time is reached.

# Features
- Set Alarm: Users can enter the desired alarm time using the 24-hour format.
- Validation: The application validates the entered time to ensure it follows the HH:MM:SS format.
- Alarm Notification: When the current time matches the set alarm time, a pop-up message notifies the user that it's time to wake up.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library

# Usage
- Launch the application.
- Enter the desired alarm time in the 24-hour format (HH:MM:SS).
- Click the "Set Alarm" button.
- The application will display a status message indicating that the alarm has been set.
- When the set alarm time is reached, a pop-up message will appear, notifying you to wake up.
